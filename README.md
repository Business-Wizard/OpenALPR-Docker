# OpenALPR Docker Image [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SketchingDev/OpenALPR-Docker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SketchingDev/OpenALPR-Docker)

## Example usages

The following examples show how to use OpenALPR's `prewarp` configuration generated by the [camera calibration](https://github.com/openalpr/openalpr/wiki/Camera-Calibration) utility. In the latter example this is combined with the ability to crop multiple regions of the image.

The license plates recognized after each preprocess rule are combined into a single JSON response.

**Poll URL for an image every 10 seconds**

```
docker run flyingtophat/alpr http://example.com/traffic_cam \
  --interval 10 \
  --verbose
```

**Pre-process each image retrieved from URL before recognition**

```
docker run flyingtophat/alpr http://example.com/traffic_cam \
  --verbose \
  --preprocess planar,429.000000,300.000000,-0.000000,0.000000,0.670000,1.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000
```

*The rule passed in is the value generated by [OpenALPR's camera calibration](https://github.com/openalpr/openalpr/wiki/Camera-Calibration) utility. Further information on the value can
be found in [OpenALPR's configuration file](https://github.com/openalpr/openalpr/blob/ab1a9e20ab699fc5dec756acd44456f2d4b4c106/config/openalpr.conf.defaults) for the `prewarp` option*

**Pre-process cropped regions of the image retrieved from URL before recognition**

```
docker run flyingtophat/alpr http://example.com/traffic_cam \
  --verbose \
  --preprocess 0,0,435,299=planar,429.000000,300.000000,-0.000000,0.000000,0.670000,1.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000 \
  --preprocess 435,0,705,299=planar,272.000000,300.000000,-0.000000,0.000000,-0.650000,1.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000
```

*In this example the prewarp rules are applied to their respective cropped area (<x1,y1,x2,y2>=<prewarp>) and all license plates are combined into a single JSON response.*
